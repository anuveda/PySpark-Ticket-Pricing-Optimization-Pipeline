# PySpark Ticket Pricing Optimization Pipeline

## Project Overview
Implemented a PySpark-based data processing and machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict ticket prices for sports events using data from SeatGeek and Ticketmaster. Emphasized data integration, cleansing, linear regression for predictive analytics, clustering for fan segmentation, real-time engagement strategies, revenue optimization, and visualization for strategic planning and decision-making.

## Data Integration and Cleansing
- Refined data from SeatGeek and Ticketmaster to enhance fan profiling and improve data quality.

## Advanced Predictive Analytics
- Developed a linear regression model to predict ticket prices, enabling dynamic pricing strategies.
- Model achieved a high R-squared value of 0.9019, indicating strong predictive power.

## Clustering for Fan Segmentation
- Utilized KMeans clustering to segment fans based on purchase behavior, ticket prices, and engagement metrics.
- Informed targeted marketing strategies.

## Real-Time Engagement and Upgrades
- Implemented strategies to offer real-time seat upgrades and personalized in-app notifications to enhance fan experience and maximize revenue.

## Revenue Optimization
- Compared predicted ticket prices with actual prices to identify potential revenue increases.
- On average, the model increased revenue by $9.12 per ticket, projecting a significant revenue boost for a sold-out stadium.

## Visualization and Reporting
- Generated visual representations of model performance and cluster analysis to facilitate data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
- Notebooks and visualizations included in the project.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, PySpark, SQL
